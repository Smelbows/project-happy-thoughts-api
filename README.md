# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project creates a backend Mongo database with an API hosted on heroku that can receive both GET and POST requests. It is an API to link to the previously built 'happy thoughts' front end, which is a site where happy thoughts can be posted, viewed and liked.

## The problem

I linked a new Mongo cloud collection into my technigo projects cluster, used postman to send and view the GET and POST results and mongo compass to view the data in the database. I hosted this site on heroku and the front end that uses the API is hosted on netlify.
